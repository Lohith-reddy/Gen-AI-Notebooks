    "To Develop features that a teacher would require, we need to empathise with the teacher. So, Let's jump into the shoes of a teacher. Let's say Our first assignment is to teach about Newton's third law of motion to grade 8 students. Below is the lesson material provided by our institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson Material:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Title: Understanding Newton's Third Law: Action and Reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define Newton's Third Law of Motion.\n",
    "2. Identify action and reaction force pairs in various scenarios.\n",
    "3. Explain real-life applications of Newton's Third Law.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Body:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is Newton's Third Law?**\n",
    "   - Explain that Newton's Third Law states: \"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\"\n",
    "   - Break down the meaning of this law: when one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts a force of equal magnitude in the opposite direction on the first object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Action and Reaction Pairs:**\n",
    "   - Provide examples and ask students to identify the action and reaction force pairs in each scenario. Examples could include:\n",
    "     - A person pushing against a wall.\n",
    "     - A ball bouncing off the ground.\n",
    "     - A swimmer pushing against the water.\n",
    "   - Encourage students to think about the forces involved and how they act on different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Real-Life Applications:**\n",
    "   - Discuss real-life examples where Newton's Third Law is at play, such as:\n",
    "     - Rocket propulsion: The action force is the expulsion of gas from the rocket engines, and the reaction force is the resulting upward movement of the rocket.\n",
    "     - Walking: Each step involves pushing against the ground, which pushes back with an equal force, propelling the person forward.\n",
    "     - Driving a car: The tires push against the road, and the road pushes back, propelling the car forward.\n",
    "   - Encourage students to brainstorm other examples they encounter in daily life.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "Review the key points of the lesson:\n",
    "- Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n",
    "- Action and reaction force pairs exist in all interactions between objects.\n",
    "- Understanding Newton's Third Law helps us explain and predict motion in the world around us.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assessment:**\n",
    "Conduct a short quiz or discussion to assess students' understanding of Newton's Third Law and their ability to identify action and reaction force pairs in different scenarios. Encourage students to ask questions if they need further clarification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extension:**\n",
    "Challenge students to research and present on advanced applications of Newton's Third Law, such as in sports, engineering, or space exploration. This can deepen their understanding and appreciation of the concept."

    "A lesson hook is a tool used by teacher to grab students' attention and maintaining their engagement, providing a gateway into the lesson's content.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lesson hook can take various forms, such as a question, activity, game, story, or compelling analogy. Each topic can be approached and explained from diverse angles. An effective lesson hook not only seizes attention but also makes the subject matter relevant to students' lives, sparking curiosity and fostering a desire to delve deeper into the topic.\n",

    "However, brainstorming lesson hooks for each topic can be overwhelming, particularly when dealing with multiple classes or classes with varying cognitive levels.

      "1. \"Egg Drop Challenge\": Begin by showing the students a raw egg and ask them if they think it will break if you drop it on the ground. Then, ask them what will happen if you drop an egg on a hard floor from a greater height. This will get students thinking about force and motion. Next, divide the class into groups and give them materials such as straws, paper, tape, and a plastic cup. Challenge the students to create a device that will protect the egg when dropped from a height. This activity will demonstrate Newton's third law of motion that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n",

      "2. \"Balloon Rockets\": Inflate balloons and attach them to a string that is stretched across the classroom. Have students tape a straw to the balloon, attach a long piece of string to the straw, and hold the other end of the string. When the balloon is released, the air rushes out of the balloon in one direction, causing the balloon to move in the opposite direction. This activity will help students understand the concept of force and motion and how it relates to Newton's third law of motion.\n",

      "3. \"Tug of War\": Divide the class into two teams and set up a tug of war game. After a few rounds, have students discuss the forces they used to pull the rope. This will help them understand Newton's third law of motion, that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. \"Mentos and Soda\": Show the students a video of Mentos being dropped into a bottle of soda. Ask them what they think is happening and how it relates to Newton's third law of motion. Then, conduct a demonstration where students can drop Mentos into a bottle of soda and observe the reaction. This will help reinforce the concept of forces and motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. \"Bouncing Balls\": Show the students a variety of different types of balls and have them hypothesize which balls will bounce the highest. Then, have them drop the balls from the same height and measure the heights of the bounces. This will demonstrate how different forces can affect the motion of an object and how this relates to Newton's third law of motion.\n"

    "1. Define Newton's Third Law of Motion.\n",
    "2. Identify action and reaction force pairs in various scenarios.\n",

    "   - Explain that Newton's Third Law states: \"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\"\n",
    "   - Break down the meaning of this law: when one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts a force of equal magnitude in the opposite direction on the first object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Action and Reaction Pairs:**\n",
    "   - Provide examples and ask students to identify the action and reaction force pairs in each scenario. Examples could include:\n",
    "     - A person pushing against a wall.\n",
    "     - A ball bouncing off the ground.\n",
    "     - A swimmer pushing against the water.\n",

    "**3. Real-Life Applications:**\n",
    "   - Discuss real-life examples where Newton's Third Law is at play, such as:\n",
    "     - Rocket propulsion: The action force is the expulsion of gas from the rocket engines, and the reaction force is the resulting upward movement of the rocket.\n",
    "     - Walking: Each step involves pushing against the ground, which pushes back with an equal force, propelling the person forward.\n",
    "     - Driving a car: The tires push against the road, and the road pushes back, propelling the car forward.\n",
    "   - Encourage students to brainstorm other examples they encounter in daily life.\n",

A temperature set at 0 equates to argmax or maximum likelihood, representing the token with the highest probability. A higher temperature modifies the probabilities in such a way that all probabilities are closer to each other i.e., the model has only slightly more confidence in it's top choices.

We can see that the simple trick of placing explanation above correct answer works much better than a standard CoT trick. This illustrates that prompt engineering is an emperical field and experimentation is the only way to find the best prompt."
